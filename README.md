Music Store Analysis Using SQL - Music Playlist Database Analysis  

In this project, I analyzed an online music store's database to gain insights into business growth. By querying the music playlist dataset with SQL, I answered key questions and uncovered trends to support strategic decisions.

Database and Tools:

MySQL: Used for database management and querying.
MySQL Workbench: Utilized for database administration, query execution, and data visualization.

Through this analysis, I explored user preferences, identified patterns, and provided actionable recommendations to optimize the store's music selection and enhance customer engagement.
